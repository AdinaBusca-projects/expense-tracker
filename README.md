"Expense Tracker" is GUI-based expense tracker where users can log their expanses and categorize them by date, amount, category and description. 
The app provides a summary of total spending by category and time period in the form of a graph (made by using the Python library Matplotlib).
The app also has a "Save Expense Changes" button that saves all the current logs and writes them back to the CSV file. Hence, once the users press the "Save Expense Changes" button, no summary can be provided anytmore.
